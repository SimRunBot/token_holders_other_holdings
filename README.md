## Try the App here:
## [https://simrunbot.github.io/token_holders_other_holdings/](https://simrunbot.github.io/token_holders_other_holdings/)

## What this App does
When you input an ERC-20 Token Address it shows you the top 10 or, depending on your input, more token holders.
\
Additionally you can view the other tokens they hold.
\
Entering an Ethplorer API-Key is optional, as the provided one is usually sufficient.
\
But if you want to make sure your search will be more reliably fast and uninterrupted then get your own api-key and use it in the input field.
