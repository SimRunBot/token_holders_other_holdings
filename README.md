# Try the App here:
# [https://simrunbot.github.io/token_holders_other_holdings/](https://simrunbot.github.io/token_holders_other_holdings/)

## What this App does
You can input an ERC-20 Token Address and in response you get the top 10 holders of that token (adjustable to 1-1000 via number of holders input field).\
After that you can click on "Show Holders other tokens" to display the other tokens held by that particular address.\
Entering an Ethplorer API-Key is optional, as the provided one is used by default, but entering your own will make sure you will not encounter network ressource limits so fast.
